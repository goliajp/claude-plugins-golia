# rotation kernel — INV-1..5 pre-act gate.
#
# Run by the Stop hook at every turn end while a rotation intent is
# pending (.claude/autorun-intent): green consumes the intent, red keeps
# it for the next turn end.
#
# Usage:
#   .claude/rotation/check.sh [rotation_id]
#
# rotation_id is optional. When present, INV-5 (uniqueness) runs against
# `rotations.jsonl`. When absent, INV-5 is skipped (still PASS, marked
# "skipped").
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — all applicable INVs PASS
#   1  — at least one INV FAIL; stderr summarises with `FAILED: INV-x ...`
#   2  — internal error (helper missing, project dir unreadable, etc.)
#
# stdout: one line per INV, `INV-N STATE one-line-detail`. STATE is one
# of PASS / FAIL / SKIP. Lines are stable for greppability by P1.2/P1.3
# and for self-test assertions.
#
# stderr (FAIL only): a `FAILED: INV-N [INV-M ...]` summary line, plus
# any extra context the per-INV check emitted.

# handoffAgeSec of 7489 — handoff.md was 2 h stale relative to
# trigger.sh. The new session would resume on a handoff that describes
# state preceding the actual prevHead. 90 s matches README Layer 1
# planned threshold (allows the agent to save then trigger inside the

# ── INV-2 — working tree clean ──────────────────────────────────────────

# converts the silent loss into a loud gate failure.

# ── INV-3 — gate pass count non-decreasing vs last jsonl row ────────────
# Why: P0 baseline already exhibits monotonic-non-decreasing across 10
# rows; P1 turns the observation into a machine gate. The current
# reading comes from the same helper `autorun_record_rotation` uses for
# the row's `conformanceBefore` field (the gate triple, schema name kept),
# so this check matches what the next row records.
#
# 2026-09-07: that helper used to probe a profile memory layout two
# generations dead and returned "" on every call, so INV-3 had been
# SKIPping unconditionally — present in the output, deciding nothing.
# It now reads the handoff `gate: N/F/S` line (TRIG-3 contract), so the
# invariant actually compares two numbers. Prior rows all recorded null,
# so the first real comparison happens one rotation after the fix.

# ── INV-4 — handoff.md non-empty + carries a real rotate-trigger section ─
# Why: file existence + mtime are not enough. A 0-byte handoff, a stray
# `touch`, or a half-written save is a "phantom" handoff that would
# mislead a new session.
#
# 2026-09-07: this used to require a `> saved:` blockquote — metadata
# written by the `/handoff:handoff save` plugin. That plugin has been
# broken for months and the protocol explicitly says the agent writes
# handoff.md by hand (autorun-pipeline, rotation close sequence step 1),
# so the line has not existed in any handoff since. INV-4 therefore
# FAILed on every turn-end, which means stop_hook's green path — the
# one that consumes the intent — was structurally
# unreachable, and `check_self_test.sh` case 1 (the GREEN happy path)
# had been failing accordingly. Nobody noticed because a red stop_hook
# only writes to stderr. Same family as the two rotted probes in lib.sh
# fixed the same day: a rule and its implementation drifted apart, and
# the symptom was absorbed in silence.
#
# The check now asks for what a hand-written handoff actually has, and
# what a phantom one cannot fake: a rotate-trigger section, and at least
# one commit sha somewhere in the file. Contents of that section are
# TRIG-3's job at trigger time; INV-4 only certifies the file is real.

# ── INV-5 — rotation_id not yet present in rotations.jsonl ──────────────
# Why: rotation_id is `r-<unix-ts>-<4 hex>`, so same-second collisions
# collapse to 1 / 65536. Tiny absolute risk, near-zero cost to guard.
# Without the guard, a duplicate id would silently corrupt downstream
# audit / dashboard joins.
#
# IMPORTANT: this check is only meaningful at the *pre-append* moment
# (i.e. inside trigger.sh BEFORE it calls autorun_record_rotation). By
# the time stop_hook runs, trigger.sh has already appended
# the rid → any check that passes the rid will FAIL here. The fix is
# at the call site: stop_hook MUST omit the rid → INV-5
# SKIPs. See stop_hook.sh for the rationale comments,
# and check_self_test.sh case-4 for the path that does pass a rid
# (simulating a same-second collision).
